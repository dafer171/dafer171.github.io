          Is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It
          borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the
          east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the
          west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border
          with the province of British Columbia. With a population of
          approximately 1.8 million and an area of 83,570 square miles (216,400
          km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the 13th least populous and the 7th
          least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital and
          largest city is Boise.

          For thousands of years Idaho has been inhabited by Native American
          peoples. In the early 19th century, Idaho was considered part of the
          Oregon Country, an area disputed between the United States and the
          British Empire. It officially became U.S. territory with the signing
          of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho Territory was not
          organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in Oregon
          Territory and Washington Territory. Idaho was eventually admitted to
          the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state.
        </p>

          Forming part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated Cascadia
          bioregion), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and
          climatic regions. The state's north, the relatively isolated Idaho
          Panhandle, is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it
          shares the Pacific Time Zone—the rest of the state uses the Mountain
          Time Zone. The state's south includes the Snake River Plain (which has
          most of the population and agricultural land). The state's southeast
          incorporates part of the Great Basin. Idaho is quite mountainous, and
          contains several stretches of the Rocky Mountains. The United States
          Forest Service holds about 38% of Idaho's land, the highest proportion
          of any state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing,
          agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism. A number of science and
          technology firms are either headquartered in Idaho or have factories
          there, and the state also contains the Idaho National Laboratory,
          which is the country's largest Department of Energy facility. Idaho's
          agricultural sector supplies many products, but the state is best
          known for its potato crop, which comprises around one-third of the
          nationwide yield. The official state nickname is the "Gem State",
          which references Idaho's natural beauty.
