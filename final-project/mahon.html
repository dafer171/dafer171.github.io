        <p>
          Mahón (Spanish: [maˈon]), officially Maó (Catalan: [məˈo]),[2] and
          also written as Mahon or Port Mahon in English, is the capital and
          second largest city of Menorca. The city is located on the eastern
          coast of the island, which is part of the archipelago and autonomous
          community of the Balearic Islands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahón has one of the longest natural harbours in the world: 5
          kilometres (3 miles) long and up to 900 metres (3,000 feet) wide. The
          water is deep but remains mostly clear due to the port's enclosed
          nature. Mayonnaise is considered to have originated in Mahón.
        </p>
        <p>Its population in 2021 was estimated to be 29,125.</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The name's origin is attributed to the Carthaginian general Mago
          Barca, brother to Hannibal, who is thought to have taken refuge there
          in 205 BC.[5][6] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it became
          part of the Eastern Roman Empire; it suffered raids from Vikings and
          Arabs until the Islamic Caliphate of Córdoba conquered it in 903.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahón was captured in 1287 from the Moors by Alfonso III of Aragon and
          incorporated into the Kingdom of Majorca, a vassal kingdom of the
          Crown of Aragon. Its harbour, one of the most strategically important
          in the western Mediterranean, was refortified.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1535, the Ottomans, under Hayreddin Barbarossa, attacked Mahón and
          took 6,000 captives as slaves back to Algiers, in the Sack of Mahon.
        </p>
        <h3>British rule</h3>
        <p>
          Menorca was captured in 1708 by a joint British–Dutch force on behalf
          of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, during the War of the Spanish
          Succession. The British saw the island's potential as a naval base and
          sought to take full control. Its status as a British possession was
          confirmed by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. During the island's years
          as a British dependency, the capital was moved from Ciutadella de
          Menorca to Mahon, which then served as residence for the governor, the
          most famous being General Richard Kane. During this period the natural
          harbour leading to the town and surrounding settlements were sometimes
          collectively known as "Port Mahon".
        </p>
        <p>
          The island was lost to the French in 1756 following the naval Battle
          of Menorca and the final Siege of Fort St Philip, which took place
          several miles from the town. After their defeat in the Seven Years'
          War, France returned the island to the British in 1763. In a joint
          Franco-Spanish effort and following a long five month invasion, the
          British surrendered the island again in 1782; It was transferred to
          Spain in 1783 as part of the Peace of Paris. The British recaptured
          the island in 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars. The British
          and the French tried (and failed) to end hostilities between
          themselves with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. Both nations agreed to
          cede or withdraw from certain territories, with the island of Menorca
          passing to the Spanish, with whom it has remained since
