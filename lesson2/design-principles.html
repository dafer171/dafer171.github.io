    <h2>Principle of Alignment</h2>
    <h3>Nike Company</h3>
    <a href="https://www.nike.com/es/w/full-price-4an3x">Nike Alignment</a>
    <img src="images/Nike_Alignment.png" alt="Nike Alignment" />
    <p>
      I think that in this screenshot you can see a perfect alignment very
      clearly. The alignment is both horizontal and vertical.

    <h2>Principle of Repetition</h2>
    <h3>Xiaomi Company</h3>
    <a href="https://mobile.mi.com/es/">Xiaomi Repetition</a>
    <img src="images/Xiaomi_Repetition.png" alt="Xiaomi Repetition" />
    <p>
      In this screenshot we can notice some things that are constantly repeated
      on the web page: 1. The font is very consistent throughout the page. 2.
      The same font color is used, black for the body copy and orange for the
      prices. 3. The buy now button is exactly the same on every product. 4. The
      sequence of product, description, price and advertising banner is repeated
      throughout the page.

    <h2>Principle of Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    <h3>Canom Company</h3>
    <a
      href="https://www.canon.es/support/consumer_products/software/ij-scan-utility.html?os=windows%2010%20(64-bit)&language="
      >Canom Visual Hierarchy</a
    >
    <img src="images/Canon_Visual_Herarchy.png" alt="Canom Visual Hierarchy" />
    <p>
      In this screenshot we can see that what stands out first is the name of
      the brand, it is in bold and in a striking color, the color of the brand.
      Next in importance may be the name of the utility. Then we can see two
      call to action: A survey that we are invited to do and select our product
