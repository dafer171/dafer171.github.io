          Preston is a city in Franklin County, Idaho, United States. The
          population was 5,204 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat
          of Franklin County. It is part of the Logan, Utah-Idaho Metropolitan
          Statistical Area.
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Bear River Massacre occurred in 1863 at a point a few miles
          northwest of Preston. The Bear River Massacre Site is a National
          Historic Landmark.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1866, Latter-day Saint (LDS, or Mormon) pioneers arrived in the
          northern end of the Cache Valley, stretching across southeastern Idaho
          and northeastern Utah. They founded a community in that location and
          named it Worm Creek, but in 1881 changed it to Preston because leaders
          of the LDS Church in Salt Lake City objected to the name "Worm Creek"
          being part of any church congregation's name. The name Preston was
          suggested by a local member to honor William B. Preston, who at the
          time was president of the LDS Church's Cache Stake.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was not until the 1880s while William C. Parkinson was serving as
          the bishop of the Preston LDS Ward that a regular townsite was laid
          out.
        </p>
        <h3>Festivities</h3>
        <p>
          For several years the city held a "Napoleon Dynamite Festival" in the
          summer. Many of the featured festival themes related to events
          occurring during the film. For example: Tetherball Tournament, Tater
          Tot Eating Contest, Moon Boot Dance, Impersonation, Look-A-Like
          Contest, Football Throwing Contest and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004 there was a single day event that drew approximately 300
          people. Although this was not a large crowd, it did help raise $1,500
          for the Preston School District Education Foundation. In 2005 an
          estimated 6,000 people attended the event, but that number dropped to
          an estimated 400 people in 2006. The 2007 and 2008 event was held
          along with the 'That Famous Preston Night Rodeo' in Preston.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no plans for reviving the event. 'That Famous Preston Night
          Rodeo' is usually held in late July, along with the Franklin County
          parade. The rodeo's name ('That Famous Preston Night Rodeo') comes
          from it being the first rodeo held during night time. It includes many
          events such as bull riding, barrel racing, and other popular events.
          The Franklin county parade includes floats and advertisements of local
          businesses. The rodeo and parade remain one of the town's most popular
          local events and traditions.
