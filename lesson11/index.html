          Is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It
          borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the
          east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the
          west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border
          with the province of British Columbia. With a population of
          approximately 1.8 million and an area of 83,570 square miles (216,400
          km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the 13th least populous and the 7th
          least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital and
          largest city is Boise. For thousands of years Idaho has been inhabited
          by Native American peoples. In the early 19th century, Idaho was
          considered part of the Oregon Country, an area disputed between the
          United States and the British Empire. It officially became U.S.
          territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a
          separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863, instead being
          included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory.
          Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming
          the 43rd state. Forming part of the Pacific Northwest (and the
          associated Cascadia bioregion), Idaho is divided into several distinct
          geographic and climatic regions. The state's north, the relatively
          isolated Idaho Panhandle, is closely linked with Eastern Washington
          with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone—the rest of the state uses
          the Mountain Time Zone. The state's south includes the Snake River
          Plain (which has most of the population and agricultural land). The
          state's southeast incorporates part of the Great Basin. Idaho is quite
          mountainous, and contains several stretches of the Rocky Mountains.
          The United States Forest Service holds about 38% of Idaho's land, the
          highest proportion of any state. Industries significant for the state
          economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and
          tourism. A number of science and technology firms are either
          headquartered in Idaho or have factories there, and the state also
          contains the Idaho National Laboratory, which is the country's largest
          Department of Energy facility. Idaho's agricultural sector supplies
          many products, but the state is best known for its potato crop, which
          comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield. The official state
          nickname is the "Gem State", which references Idaho's natural beauty.
