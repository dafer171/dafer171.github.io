    <h3>Typography</h3>

    <h4>Heading Font: Roboto</h4>
    <p>
      I decided on this font because it looks very modern and trendy, it is also
      a Google font so it won't take too long to load.
    </p>

    <h4>Paragraph Font: Noto Sans JP</h4>
    <p>
      I chose this font because it seems a very good combination with Roboto, it
      is also very easy to read
    </p>

    <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
    <p>
      The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
      offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
      Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
      Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
    </p>

    <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
    <p class="colored">
      Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
      physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
      adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen
